In order to run the algorithms you need to give some outputs

- first of all, the algorithm name. you can choose between UCS, IDS, A*, IDA*

- second, you need to give the start point position, for example 0,0

- third, you need to give the start point position, for example 4,4

- give the size of the gird. in this assignment, we assume the gird is a nXn matrix, for example 4

- give the grid for the algorithm, where -1 represents a barrier. for example:

1,1,1,1
1,1,1,1
1,1,1,1    this grid is a 4X4 grid (we entered 4 as the grid size)
1,1,1,1


- after you entered the grid you will recive the best path according to the algorithm and the length of the path
